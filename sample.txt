Police have arrested 1,000 people suspected of being part of a movement blamed for the failed 2016 coup.Another 2,200 were being sought as authorities targeted what they said was a secret structure within Turkey's police force.Turkey says a movement loyal to US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen organised the July 2016 plot to bring down President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Earlier this month the president won a referendum on boosting his powers.As a result of the narrow victory Mr Erdogan can become head of the executive, beefing up the largely ceremonial role of Turkey's president.
